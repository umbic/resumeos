## Next Up

1. **Test ATS Keywords Flow** — Verify the full user flow works in production
2. **Bug fixes** — Address any issues discovered during testing

---

## Recent Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Keyword detection method | Claude semantic analysis | More accurate than substring matching for detecting if keywords are naturally incorporated |
| Junior skills filter | Hardcoded list in rules.ts | Simple and effective for executive-level resumes |

---

## Known Issues / Bugs

- None discovered yet (feature just deployed)

---

## Feature Specs Available

| Feature | Spec File | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Highlight Customizations Toggle | `FEATURE_SPEC_HIGHLIGHT_CUSTOMIZATIONS.md` | Done |
| Enhanced JD Analysis + ATS Keywords | `IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS_JD_ANALYSIS.md` | Done |

## Notes for Next Session

- Read project files first: `unified_content_database_v4.md`, `resume_system_design_v3.md`
- Don't fabricate resume content — only select/reframe from database
- Execute, don't plan. Build incrementally, commit often.
- Test the ATS keywords feature with a real job description
