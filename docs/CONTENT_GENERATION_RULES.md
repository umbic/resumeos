# ResumeOS Content Generation Rules

## Purpose

This document defines how Claude generates and tailors resume content. These rules ensure the output reads like a polished executive resume — not a keyword-stuffed ATS hack.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Quality over keyword density.** 

It's better to have a resume that reads beautifully and hits 60% of keywords than one that hits 90% but sounds like a robot wrote it. Executives get hired by humans, not ATS bots. The ATS just gets you to the human.

---

## Part 1: What Claude CAN and CANNOT Change

### ✅ CAN Modify

| Element | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Action verbs** | Swap for variety and JD alignment (Led → Drove → Built) |
| **Adjectives/descriptors** | Use as keyword insertion opportunities ("customer-centric", "data-driven") |
| **Sentence structure** | Reorder emphasis to highlight JD-relevant aspects first |
| **Hook phrases** (Career Highlights) | Rewrite to mirror JD language |
| **Industry terminology** | Translate to JD vocabulary where authentic |

### ❌ CANNOT Modify

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Metrics and numbers** | These are facts — never fabricate or round |
| **Client/company names** | Cannot add, remove, or change |
| **Scope/scale claims** | Cannot inflate team size, budget, etc. |
| **Capabilities not in original** | Cannot add skills or experiences that don't exist |
| **Dates and titles** | Fixed employment history |

---

## Part 2: Bullet Structure (CAR Method)

Every bullet should follow the **CAR structure**:

```
[Action Verb] + [Challenge/What] + [Approach/How] + [Result/Metrics]
```

### Formula

```
{Verb} {what you did} {for whom/context}, {method/approach}, {delivering/resulting in} {quantified outcome}
```

### Examples

**Good:**
> Built creator commerce platform's first global brand strategy post-$300M investment, launching multi-channel campaign that drove 8% customer acquisition and scaled platform from $2.8B to $5B

**Bad:**
> Spearheaded go-to-market and branding for creator commerce platform, positioning as leader and leveraging multi-channel strategies and data-driven marketing approaches to drive customer acquisition

The bad example:
- Uses "spearheaded" (overused)
- Has vague phrases ("positioning as leader")
- Keyword stuffs ("leveraging", "data-driven marketing approaches")
- Buries the impressive metrics

---

## Part 3: Action Verb Rules

### Rule: No Repetition
- **Same verb max 1x per position**
- **Same verb max 2x in entire resume**

### Verb Rotation Bank

Use these categories to ensure variety:

| Category | Verbs |
|----------|-------|
| **Building** | Built, Developed, Created, Established, Launched, Designed |
| **Leading** | Led, Directed, Oversaw, Managed, Headed, Guided |
| **Growing** | Grew, Scaled, Expanded, Increased, Accelerated, Drove |
| **Transforming** | Transformed, Repositioned, Modernized, Revitalized, Redesigned |
| **Strategy** | Architected, Defined, Shaped, Crafted, Pioneered, Championed |
| **Executing** | Delivered, Executed, Implemented, Activated, Orchestrated |

### Tracking

Claude must track verbs used across the resume and select from unused options.

---

## Part 4: Keyword Integration Rules

### Philosophy: Translate, Don't Stuff

Instead of inserting JD keywords awkwardly, find YOUR existing language that maps to THEIR keywords.

**Example:**
- JD says: "customer-centric transformation"
- Your original: "shifted CRM approach to focus on retention"
- Tailored: "Led customer-centric transformation of CRM, shifting focus to retention"

### Where to Insert Keywords

| Location | Keyword Density | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Summary** | High (8-12 keywords) | This is your ATS zone — front-load here |
| **Career Highlights hooks** | Medium (1-2 per highlight) | Hooks can be rewritten for JD alignment |
| **Position Overview** | Medium (3-5 keywords) | Natural integration in narrative |
| **Bullets** | Low (1-2 per bullet) | Focus on clarity and results |

### Insertion Opportunities

Use these grammatical slots for natural keyword placement:

1. **Adjectives before nouns**: "Led [customer-centric] transformation"
2. **Prepositional phrases**: "through [data-driven] marketing strategies"
3. **Appositives**: "a [B2B] brand strategist"
4. **Verb choices**: "Drove" instead of "Led" if JD emphasizes driving results

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't stack multiple keywords in one phrase:
> "leveraging AI-enabled personalization and data-driven marketing strategies"

❌ Don't insert keywords that don't fit the context:
> "Spearheaded customer-centric go-to-market transformation leveraging cross-functional stakeholder management"

❌ Don't repeat the same keyword 5+ times across the resume

---

## Part 5: Career Highlights Format

### Structure

```
[Bold Hook Phrase]: [Supporting text with context and metrics]
```

### Hook Phrase Rules

- **Can be rewritten** to mirror JD language
- Should be **punchy and specific** (not generic)
- **5-8 words max**
- Must **telegraph the achievement** instantly

### Examples

**Good hooks:**
- "Scaled brand practice from $15M to $40M"
- "Drove 64% revenue growth for regional bank"
- "Launched $727M direct-to-consumer platform"

**Bad hooks:**
- "Spearheaded strategic transformation initiative" (vague)
- "Led cross-functional team" (generic)
- "Delivered results for client" (meaningless)

### Supporting Text Rules

- Include the **context** (what was the challenge/situation)
- Include the **method** (how you approached it)
- Include **2-3 metrics** (quantified results)
- **2-3 sentences max**

---

## Part 6: Position Overview Rules

### Purpose
Set the stage: what was the mandate, scope, and context of this role?

### Structure (2-3 sentences)
1. **Context**: What were you brought in to do? What was the situation?
2. **Scope**: Team size, budget, client base, geographic reach
3. **Impact preview**: High-level summary of outcomes (details go in bullets)

### Example

> Promoted to lead Deloitte's Brand Strategy & Activation practice at a time when CMOs faced increasing pressure to tie brand investment to revenue. Oversaw a team of 35+ strategists serving Fortune 500 clients across healthcare, financial services, and technology. Built the practice from $15M to $40M while establishing Deloitte as a leader in strategic brand consulting.

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't keyword stuff the overview:
> "Promoted to lead customer-centric, data-driven brand transformation practice leveraging cross-functional stakeholder management and AI-enabled go-to-market strategies..."

❌ Don't list bullets in paragraph form

---

## Part 7: Summary Rules

### Purpose
The summary is your **ATS power zone** — this is where you front-load keywords while still sounding human.

### Structure (4-5 sentences)

1. **Identity statement**: Who you are + years of experience + core expertise
2. **Value proposition**: What you do for organizations
3. **Proof points**: Types of companies/industries served
4. **Method**: How you approach work
5. **Outcome focus**: What results you deliver

### Keyword Density
- Target **8-12 keywords** naturally integrated
- Prioritize **hard skills** and **industry terms** here
- This is where you can be slightly more keyword-dense

### Example

> A B2B brand strategist and cross-functional executive with 15+ years of experience helping enterprise organizations reimagine how they show up in market. Partners with C-suite and product leaders to elevate brand from a communications tool to a revenue-driving asset, building platforms that scale—from repositioning legacy institutions to launching new category leaders. Has led brand platform development, portfolio alignment, and go-to-market positioning for global consulting firms, SaaS leaders, and financial services institutions. Known for blending creative vision with analytical precision, driving multi-channel campaigns, demand generation, and scalable brand systems that deliver measurable results.

## Part 8: Highlight Marking (<mark> Tags)

### When to Mark

Only mark text that was **intentionally changed** to mirror JD language:
- Keyword insertions
- Terminology translations
- Reframed phrases

### When NOT to Mark

- Original content that happened to match JD
- Entire sentences
- Every adjective

### Density Target

- **Summary**: 8-12 marks total
- **Career Highlight**: 1-3 marks per highlight
- **Overview**: 3-5 marks
- **Bullet**: 1-2 marks max

If more than 30% of text is highlighted, you've over-marked.

---

## Part 9: Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any section, Claude should verify:

### Content Quality
- [ ] No action verb repeated within this position
- [ ] No verb used more than 2x in entire resume
- [ ] Every bullet has a quantified result
- [ ] No keyword stuffing (max 2-3 keywords per sentence)
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] No metrics or facts were changed

### Keyword Integration
- [ ] Keywords feel invisible, not forced
- [ ] Translated to user's language where possible
- [ ] Highest density in Summary, lowest in bullets
- [ ] Mark tags used sparingly

### Format
- [ ] Career highlights have bold hook + supporting text
- [ ] Overviews are 2-3 sentences of context
- [ ] Bullets follow CAR structure

---

## Part 10: Prompt Requirements

Every content generation prompt to Claude MUST include:

1. **These rules** (or a condensed version)
2. **The JD analysis** (positioning themes + keywords)
3. **Verb tracking** (which verbs have been used so far)
4. **The original content** from the database
5. **Clear instruction** on what section this is for

Claude should NEVER generate content without knowing:
- What verbs are already used
- What keywords are still unaddressed
- What the positioning themes are

---

```json
{
  "verbs_used": {
    "summary": [],
    "highlights": ["Built", "Drove", "Led", "Pioneered", "Launched"],
    "position_1_overview": ["Promoted", "Oversaw"],
    "position_1_bullets": ["Developed", "Scaled", "Designed", "Partnered"],

}
```

## Next Step: Prompt Audit

To implement these rules, we need to audit all current Claude prompts in ResumeOS.

**Claude Code should provide:**
1. All prompts currently used in `/api/analyze-jd`
2. All prompts currently used in `/api/generate-section`
3. All prompts used for refinement/regeneration
4. How conversation history is (or isn't) being passed between calls

Then we can rewrite each prompt to follow these rules.
