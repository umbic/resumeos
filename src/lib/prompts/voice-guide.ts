## Voice Guide: Umberto Castaldo

### Who He Is
Umberto is a brand strategist who believes great marketing solves business problems through culturally relevant narratives. He bridges consulting rigor with creative craft. He's spent 15 years transforming how companies connect with customers, from healthcare systems to sports leagues to consumer brands. He's built teams, launched products, and driven measurable business outcomes.

### His Voice
- **Confident but not arrogant**: States outcomes directly, lets results speak
- **Outcomes-focused**: Leads with impact, not process or responsibilities
- **Direct**: No hedging, no filler, no corporate-speak
- **Strategic**: Connects every tactic to business transformation
- **Human**: Writes like a person talking to a peer, not a LinkedIn bot

### Signature Ideas (use naturally when relevant)
- Great marketing solves business problems through culturally relevant narratives
- The intersection of consulting rigor and creative craft
- From customer insight to flawless execution
- Brand strategy that captivates, converts, and retains

### Words/Phrases He Would NEVER Use
- "Leveraged" / "Utilized" / "Spearheaded" / "Synergy" / "Synergistic"
- "Multi-sided marketplace" (unless he actually ran one)
- "Passion for..." / "Excited to..." / "Thrilled to..."
- "Seasoned professional" / "Results-driven" / "Dynamic leader"
- Any word ending in "-ize" when a simpler word works (incentivize -> encourage)
- "Stakeholder alignment" / "Value-add" / "Circle back"

### STRICT Formatting Rules
- NEVER use emdashes (-). Use commas, periods, or rewrite the sentence.
- NEVER use semicolons in bullets. Split into two sentences if needed.
- Bullets are complete sentences, not fragments.
- No exclamation points.
- Numbers greater than 10 as numerals (15, 300%), ten or fewer as words (five, three)
- Percentages always as numerals with % symbol (5%, 43%)
- Dollar amounts: $727M, $40M, $2.8B (use M/B abbreviations)

### Summary Guidance
The summary should:
- Be 140-160 words (this is a HARD requirement, count them)
- Open with a distinctive hook, NOT "Umberto is..." or "Umberto builds..." or "[Name] is a..."
- Include 2-3 proof points (metrics) relevant to the TARGET role
- Show personality and point of view
- End with philosophy or approach, not a list of skills
- NOT mention "$15M to $40M practice" unless applying to a consulting firm
- NOT repeat any achievement that will appear in Career Highlights

### Career Highlight Guidance
Each highlight should:
- Have a bold headline (**Headline Here**:) that's specific to the achievement
- Tell a mini-story: context -> action -> result
- Include at least one specific metric from the source
- Be 35-50 words total (including headline)
- Start with a strong, varied verb (never repeat verbs across highlights)
- Bad headlines: "Strategic Leadership", "Brand Excellence", "Marketing Success"
- Good headlines: "Healthcare Platform Launch", "Creator Economy Scale", "Sports League Turnaround"
