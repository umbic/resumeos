# SECTION 6: RULES & GUIDELINES

## Deduplication Rules

1. **Metric Exclusivity**: Each metric can appear ONLY ONCE in the entire resume
2. **Career Highlights vs. Position Bullets**: If an achievement is used in Career Highlights, it CANNOT appear in Position bullets
3. **Shared Metrics Reference**:
   - CH-01 shares metrics with P1-B02
   - CH-03 shares metrics with P1-B04
   - CH-04 shares metrics with P1-B09
   - CH-05 has unique metrics
   - CH-06 shares metrics with P1-B08
   - CH-07 shares metrics with P1-B05
   - CH-08 shares metrics with P1-B07
   - CH-09 shares metrics with P1-B03
   - CH-10 shares metrics with P4-B01 and P4-B02
   - CH-11 has unique metrics

## Branding Rules

1. **Always Branded**: Deloitte (internal achievements)
2. **Flexible Branding**: All client work can use brand name OR generic description
3. **Generic Options**:
   - Use industry descriptors: "regional bank", "healthcare system", "sports league"
   - Be specific enough to convey credibility
   - Avoid vague terms like "a company" or "a client"

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone
- Third person for Summary

- Active voice, strong verbs

### Metrics
- Always specific: "$40M" not "significant revenue"
- Format: "$40M" not "$40MM" or "40 million"
- Percentages: "43%" not "forty-three percent"

### Avoid
- "Visionary", "thought leader", "guru", "ninja"
- "Responsible for" (use what was achieved)
- "Helped", "assisted" (unless truly support role)
- "Various", "numerous" (be specific)

### Strong Verbs
Built, Scaled, Led, Drove, Developed, Launched, Repositioned, Transformed, Partnered, Pioneered, Spearheaded, Modernized
