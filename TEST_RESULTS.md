## Keyword Integration

**Keywords found in summary:** 9 (strategic storyteller, enterprise B2B, executive narratives, GTM alignment, competitive positioning, strategic messaging, leading cross-functional, measurable business impact, complex sales cycles)

**Target range:** 8-12

### Stuffing Pattern Analysis
| Pattern | Count | Assessment |
|---------|-------|------------|
| "strategic storytelling" | 10 | ⚠️ Overused |
| "executive narratives/narrative" | 7 | ⚠️ Overused |
| "GTM alignment" | 5 | Acceptable |
| "competitive positioning" | 2 | ✅ Good |

**Common stuffing phrases detected:** None of the predefined patterns ("leveraging data-driven strategies", etc.)

**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS - Keyword count in summary is appropriate (9), but "strategic storytelling" and "executive narratives" are over-indexed across the full resume, appearing in nearly every section.

**Read-aloud test observations:**

**Result:** ✅ PASS (with minor notes)

## Overall Grade

### Grade: B-

**Reasoning:** The system demonstrates solid fundamentals but over-indexes on keyword insertion. Verb tracking works well with excellent variety. The CAR structure is maintained in most bullets with strong quantifiable results. However, mark tag density is 4-5x higher than ideal, and two phrases ("strategic storytelling", "executive narratives") dominate the content to the point of repetition.

**Score Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Verb Tracking | ✅ PASS | Excellent variety, no overuse |
| Keyword Integration | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Good count but repetitive phrases |
| CAR Structure | ✅ PASS | 71% of bullets follow CAR |
| Mark Tag Density | ❌ FAIL | 43 tags vs ~12-16 target |
| Naturalness | ✅ PASS | Reads professionally |

**Recommendations:**
1. Reduce mark tags to 2-4 per section maximum
2. Vary keyword synonyms (e.g., "narrative development" instead of always "strategic storytelling")
3. Consider removing marks from obvious keywords that ATS would catch anyway
